This project builds a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a credit card account is delinquent or not based on customer data retrieved from a MySQL database. The data undergoes preprocessing, including label encoding and normalization. After splitting the data into training and test sets, the logistic model is trained and evaluated using accuracy and prediction comparison. The project helps assess credit risk through binary classification.The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 94% ,  indicating its performance in correctly classifying delinquent accounts.
